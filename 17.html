		RICE (Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancements) is a bunch of customization a linux user can apply to make their desktop (or browser start page, text editor, etc) more beautiful.
		<br></br>
		The most common things to rice are wms, especially tiling ones. for example, this is my basic dwm rice:

		To one's thought it is very difficult, but when you start doing that, it actually is really enjoyable.
		Moreover, you can learn how things on linux work.
		<br></br>
		Often, you don't use a DE (Desktop Environment) while ricing, thus you do everything from scratch.
		You choose what notification manager, file manager, text editor you are gonna have.
		If you are hardened enough to start a deeper linux journey, you can install Gentoo (my personal favourite. As flexible as LFS but is way easier) or Arch Linux or Debian.
		<br></br>
		But things don't end there.
		If you want to make your own rice, you can always look up to my dotfiles, or watch some cool channels:
